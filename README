MyLDSO
======

An optional project from *EPITA*.

[x] readelf (Really messy I was understanding the concepts while doing them)
[x] LD_LIBRARY_PATH
[x] LD_PRELOAD
[x] DT_GNU_HASH - DT_HASH
[x] BIND_NOW
[x] LAZY_BIND
[x] X86_64 relocations


Some of the code i'm actually proud of but if I had to do it again I'd do a lot differently.
Overall had a lot of fun on this project.
